# Worms
Indie Studio is the **last C++ project** of your second year in Epitech. It consists in **programming a 3D video game** with real tools. We choose the Worms, the most difficult game (and the funiest) in the list of choice. The game had to feature specific functionnalities and **to offer a real gaming experience**

This is our WorldWarWorms 3D !

The target is to Reproduce an iconic game with a graphical library (Irrlicht) in C++ to confirm our OOP skills. The game must be multi-player, but must also be able to play alone against the computer.

Time duration is about 1000 hours on 5 weeks with hard rush the 2 last week. And about 200 coffee :)
An incredible project group.

 - Firstly, I have participated in the design of the game and the division of tasks.

 - I then coupled to the random generation of the map as well as all connected destruction functions: a long **rasterizing algorithm design.**. Indeed he had created a large map (more than 10000 * 10000), show circles, triangles, lines and polygons in 3D ... For optimization questions, the display of the map s is made using a unique 3D Obj, he had created on the fly after each map destruction. For this, we studied the models of ".obj" Simple File Blender 3d shapes.

 - Once the displayed map, I made a long mork on variable management for random generation of the map. For the map is the most attractive, playable, challengeante for worms!
 
 - Finally, and not least, I handled entirely from the body of the game: the gameLoop, the physics engine and weapons management.
 
 - I also did the liaison with the graphics and implementation of AI ennemy worms.

Here is the result of how to turn coffee into a game !
